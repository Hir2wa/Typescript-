 1.How do type guards work? Give examples using typeof, in and user-defined type guard functions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-A type guard is a way to narrow down the type of a variable inside a condition,
 so TypeScript knows exactly what you're working with.
Think of it as: “Hey TypeScript, I just proved what this thing really is — now let me use it properly.”

-2. Using in — for object properties
Use this when you have different objects that share some props and differ in others.

type Admin = { role: "admin"; dashboard: string };
type User = { role: "user"; cart: string[] };

function handlePerson(person: Admin | User) {
  if ("dashboard" in person) {
    console.log("Welcome Admin:", person.dashboard);
  } else {
    console.log("User Cart:", person.cart);
  }
}

3.🧙 3. User-defined Type Guards — your own 🔥 logic
You can write your own function that returns a special type:
