 how to install typsript 
 //npm i typescript -g 
 //tsc "name of the file" better add -w to continue watching the  changes 
 //tsc --init //these create a configuration folder 
 //late after we need to config our project   through rootDir  and add the  src as the root 
//later again we need to find outerDir   inside ./build/js     these will create a js directory and its where all the compiled file for ts will be `
//later added noEmitOnError to true

1. Itro to typscript 
1.1
a.typescript a static language that means  types are checked at compler time 
-help to catch error during the development  instead in running time 
-integration of intersence help us to get error and reading them 
-great for teams 

b.js is dynamic that measn types are checked on run time 
1.2
-in typescript you explicit set types where the typscript will not enferre the types it will already now it  because you set it 
1.3
types in typescript 
-numbers 
-string 
-boolean
-union |
-any   (any types )
2.Type aliases let you name a type once and reuse it anywhere.
-type alias help us to union different type to a valiable which don't work on interface 

type ID = number | string;       // can't do this with interface
type RGB = [number, number, number];
type Status = "success" | "error";
here  on unions  and tuples and literal types  here types wins 
//key take away on typescript 
------------------------------
ðŸ§± Both type and interface:
Help you shape the structure of:

Objects
Arrays
Function types
API responses
Classes (especially with interface)
And more!
